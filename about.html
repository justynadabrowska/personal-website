            <p>I am a self-taught front end developer.<br>An Enthusiast of clean designs and code. <br>I’ve always had a strong interest in websites and the internet but never thought to pursue it as career. I regret this so much, I feel like i’ve been wasting time not doing the things i love!sLast year, Being locked down, I Decided I’m Going to learn how to make websites... because why not?
                I started with HTML then went on to CSS. this was really enjoyable  and I was having so much fun creating simple static websites. Then I went on to javascript and spent months and months trying to figure out programming and the language itself. I remember how happy i was once i figured out how parameters in functions work. that was the moment i realised that this is it! Hence I’m here now, trying to start a new career in the job I know i will love.
